The purpose of this project is to make a new theme to display the rooms' booking of the Cesi.
This display must give in a synthetic and easy readable format :

We can also add more components to this page like the actual date and hour, phone number, mail or website address, ...

A configuration file exist in a config file in wich we can configure the wanted theme, if we are debugging or not and also the numbers of column in the view.
